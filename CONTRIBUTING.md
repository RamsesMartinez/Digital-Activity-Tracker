## üìù Code Style Guidelines

### Python Code Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guidelines
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Keep functions small and focused (max 20-30 lines)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Limit line length to 79 characters

### Example

```python
def calculate_total_time(activities: list[dict]) -> timedelta:
    """
    Calculate the total time spent across all activities.
    
    Args:
        activities: List of activity dictionaries with time data
        
    Returns:
        Total time as timedelta object
    """
    total_seconds = sum(
        activity.get('duration', 0) for activity in activities
    )
    return timedelta(seconds=total_seconds)
```

### HTML/CSS/JavaScript

- Use semantic HTML elements
- Follow BEM methodology for CSS classes
- Use meaningful class and ID names
- Keep JavaScript functions small and focused
- Add comments for complex logic

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

**Good examples:**
```
Add real-time activity tracking feature
Fix dashboard not updating on pause/resume
Update README with installation instructions
```

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
make test
```

### Writing Tests

- Create test files in a `tests/` directory
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and failure cases
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for good test coverage

### Example Test

```python
import pytest
from app import format_time_display
from datetime import timedelta

def test_format_time_display():
    """Test time formatting function."""
    # Test zero time
    assert format_time_display(timedelta(0)) == "00:00:00"
    
    # Test regular time
    assert format_time_display(timedelta(hours=2, minutes=30, seconds=45)) == "02:30:45"
    
    # Test edge cases
    assert format_time_display(timedelta(seconds=3661)) == "01:01:01"
```
